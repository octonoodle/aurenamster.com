    <p>Hi, my name is Auren. I enjoy many things, like programming, engineering, and 
        learning stuff in general. I am currently in school, and I live in the US.
        If you'd like to learn more about my interests, please poke around my site!

    <h2>this site</h2>
    <p>I created this site in August 2024, mainly to showcase my
        <a href="/rocketry/archive">pursuits in rocketry</a>. It is entirely custom and
    coded by hand, with a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS frontend (except for jQuery) and
    a handmade backend utilizing the NodeJS HTTP module.</p>
