      <h1>making a rocketry club</h1>
      <p>
        how i, along with a couple of my friends, created a local rocketry club
        and participated in the national American Rocketry Competition
      </p>
    </header>
    <h2>early attempts</h2>
    <p>
      a friend of mine at school, Jake, first brought up the idea of building
      rockets as a team in the end of our freshman year. we tried to gather
      people during the fall of sophomore year but it didn't work out too well,
      because nobody we knew really knew what model rocketry was, and we didn't
      really teach them.
    </p>
    <h2>personal development</h2>
    <p>
      over the following summer and through sophomore year (2023-2024), i gradually built
      more and more advanced rockets
      <a href="/rocketry/meet-the-rockets">on my own</a>, advancing my knowledge
      of rocket fabircation and design, and Arduino programming.
    </p>
    <h2>getting serious about it</h2>
    <p>
      by the spring of sophomore year, my friends and fellow rocketry nerds
      Julian and Adi had gotten into building my rockets with me, and we
      designed our first rocket as a team, Jeff. Jeff was a pretty big success
      for our first custom rocket, but it was an adjustment for me to start
      working as a team when i had gotten into my own solitary rhythm over the
      last half a year. over the summer of 2024, we built two more rockets,
      Hector and Berlioz, and by now, i was beginning to get comfortable working
      as a team with my friends.
    </p>
    <h2>the club</h2>
    <p>
      as junior year rolled around i knew i was serious about actually building
      a team for TARC that year, and so i began getting organized. Julian and
      Adi went to a different school than me so i knew i had some work cut out
      for me to organize a group with people from <em>both</em> my school and
      their school. at this time, another friend from Julian and Adi's school,
      with model rocketry experience, Nick, joined our group of club co-leaders.
      by the end of september, i had:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        established weekly meeting times at my school and Julian/Adi's school
      </li>
      <li>
        found a local organization to sponsor the TARC team independent of
        either of our schools
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>and together, the four of us:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        figured out what the club would be about (experimenting with rockets and
        doing TARC)
      </li>
      <li>advertised our club (at both schools)</li>
      <li>
        established a "curriculum" for teaching new people the basics of model
        rocketry
      </li>
      <li>
        set up communications with club members (Instagram, email, Discord
        server)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>finding new members</h2>
    <p>
      from my experience trying to start a rocketry club at my school, and
      Julian and Adi's experience at their school (Nick was the only new member
      they got), we knew we would have to spend a little while introducing
      people to model rocketry in general before we dove into strategical TARC
      team formation mode. to achieve this, we formulated a basic curriculum,
      for teaching whoever came to our meetings after we advertised our club the
      basics, in a way that they would be entertained, not overwhelmed, and
      would come back to learn more. the first few meetings went like this:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>a basic overview of how model rockets work</li>
      <li>
        an introduction to the OpenRocket rocket design software (also review of
        how model rockets work)
      </li>
      <li>an introduction to Onshape, our preferred CAD software tool</li>
      <p>and most importantly,</p>
      <li>
        guiding everybody that stayed from the first few meetings through making
        their first very own model rocket kit
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>the kit</h2>
    <p>
      we wanted to make the kit as easy as possible for our club members to do
      all on their own, both so that they could feel accomplished in their
      efforts, and also have the patience left to actually learn the inner
      workings of their rocket as they built it. to achieve this, we tried to
      simplify the build process with details like making it fully assemblable
      with just wood glue and including a pre-made fin jig, as well as writing
      up simple instructions for assembly. creating these kits included:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        designing, building and test-launching the kit before settling on the
        design (loosely based on the Estes Hi-Flier)
      </li>
      <li>sourcing materials like engine hooks from online retailers</li>
      <li>hand-cutting fins from balsa wood</li>
      <li>hand-measuring shock cord</li>
      <li>a lot of double- and triple-counting supplies</li>
      <li>writing the instructions and streamlining the assembly process</li>
    </ul>
