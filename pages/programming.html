    <h2>arduino</h2>
    <p>i have also spent a lot of time programming embedded systems <a href="/rocketry/avionics">for my rockets.</a></p>
    <h2>java and processing</h2>
    <section>
    <p>i learned java for my AP CS-A class. i think it is ok. later, i learned about processing. i think it is really cool.
      i have used processing to visualize the data from an accelerometer, and i plan to make an info dashboard to view rocket telemetry in the future.
