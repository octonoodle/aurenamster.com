    <h1>the programming page</h1>
    <p>i know several programming languages. some of them are listed below</p>
    <h2>web dev</h2>
    <section>
      <p>my experience in Javascript and HTML has mainly come from building this website. see the <a href="/about">about page</a> for more info.</a></p>
    </section>
    <h2>arduino c</h2>
    <section>
    <p>i have also spent a lot of time programming embedded systems <a href="/rocketry/avionics">for my rockets.</a>
    i work with Arduino IDE and occasionally with command-line bootloaders like <code>bossac</code>. early on,
    my code mostly stuck to the <code>setup()</code> and <code>loop()</code> program flow, but over the years 
    i have matured into using much more efficient interrupt-driven programming styles for my arduino projects,
    with the most notable of these being the code behind my chute release/altimeter system.</p>
    </section>
    <h2>c for the sake of c</h2>
    <section>
      <p>though i most often work in c in the context of arduino programming, i have done a couple of projects
        in pure c to achieve various tasks. my biggest to date is an <a href="https://github.com/octonoodle/qov">image compression algorithm</a> 
        for the QOI image format. i am interested in eventually creating a video version of QOI. WIP.
      </p>

    <h2>java and processing</h2>
    <section>
    <p>i learned java for my AP CS-A class. i think it is ok. later, i learned about processing. i think it is really cool.
      i have used processing to visualize the data from an accelerometer, and i plan to make an info dashboard to view rocket telemetry in the future.
      the <a href="/rocketry/archive">interactive scale</a> on the archive page is made with p5.js, the Javascript version of Processing!
